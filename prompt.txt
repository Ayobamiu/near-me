You're a senior full-stack engineer helping me build an MVP for a mobile app called **NearMe**. The app helps event attendees discover and connect with others physically near them. 

🧩 Core Feature:
- Users can **see who is nearby** (within ~10–50 meters), view basic profile cards, and optionally connect (e.g. via short message or QR code exchange).

💡 Key Requirements:
- React Native (Expo preferred for MVP)
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) scanning for nearby devices (mobile-only)
- GPS fallback if BLE fails or user denies permissions
- Simple user authentication (email or phone-based)
- Real-time presence updates via WebSocket or similar (Firebase is fine)
- Minimal profile: name, headline, interests
- “Nearby” tab shows list of users within range (opted in, live)
- Button to "connect" (just shows you're interested or initiates a lightweight chat)
- Each user can opt-in/opt-out of being visible at any time

🌐 Tech Stack:
- React Native + Expo
- Firebase (auth, real-time DB, presence tracking)
- BLE library like `react-native-ble-plx` or Expo alternatives

🎨 Focus on:
- Fast onboarding (one-screen sign up + join event)
- Testable flows (mock BLE users if needed)
- Mobile-first

🧪 Development Flow:
1. Set up project structure (monorepo or separate backend/mobile folders optional)
2. Implement auth + onboarding
3. Implement BLE scanning (mock if needed)
4. Set up real-time presence
5. Build Nearby tab with dummy users first
6. Add connect / simple chat (or LinkedIn link)
7. Deploy test version via Expo

Start by scaffolding the full folder structure with relevant files (BLE logic, presence hook, profile screen, etc.) and dummy components. Include package.json with dependencies and setup notes.

Ask me questions when needed.


This is the project we are working on. And we are doing a step-by-step approach. We started with basic screens, then move to auth and so on.
Let mw know where we are right now and what needs to be done next
